# Experience as a new Software Developer at Euromonitor International

I’m Barend Erasmus, 19 years young and a passionate software developer. I previously worked at a
rather small company which meant Euromonitor International would be a big change for me. 

## Before Day One

Reading and watching video about Euromonitor International gave the impression of a huge corporate
company which lead to the concern of being unrecognized and unimportant being 19 years old with less
than 2 years of experience. 

##  First Week

The first week was fun. I had a lot learn with plenty of fellow employees willing to help. I realized that it’s not a corporate company but rather a large company with a relaxed environment. It was comforting to know that as I come from such an environment, just smaller. I was handed a mentoring program which I would be following for the next 6 months. The mentoring program was changed so that I would spend time with QA first before doing any development. 

## The Time with QA

At first it was a struggle. Getting to learn the process of QA and grasping Telerik was quite difficult. To think like a tester takes more planning than I initially thought, thinking of all the scenarios and entry points. Within the first week I started to find it easier but noticed a tester has a lot of responsibility which might be the reason why QA takes long. After I’ve been with QA, I have more respect for them and understand the hurdles that they might encounter. 

## Working as a Developer

Knowing that Euromonitor developers has a large variety of skills, I was excited to start working with
them. By learning something new every day made hours feel like minutes and months like weeks. I enjoy
working in this environment where knowledge is always shared and help is provided when required.

## Goals

As I’m still young, I still want to get BSc. degree but personally I value experience more than education, thus I’m only looking to start my degree in 2019, for now I’m interested in Microsoft Certifications.
